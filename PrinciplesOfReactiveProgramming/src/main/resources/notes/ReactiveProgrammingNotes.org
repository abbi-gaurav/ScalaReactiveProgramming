* event driven systems
** composed of loosely coupled event handlers
** events are handled asynchronously
* scalable
** sclae up 
*** parallelism using multiple core systems
** scale out
*** multiple server nodes
** minimized shared mutable state
** location transparency, resilience for scale out
* resilient
** loose coupling
** strong encapsulation of state
** pervasive supervisor hierarchies                                  :doubt:
* techinques to use
** fundamental constructions from functional programming to *get composable event abstractions*
* *functions are traits, so they can also be subclassed*
** e.g. trait Map[K,V] extends (K => V)
** trait Seq[E] extends (Int => E)
* for-expressions
** the scala compiler translates for-expressions into map,flatMap and a *lazy variant of filter*
** 
* monads
** Monad M is a parameteric type M[T] that has *trait M[T]{}*
*** flatMap *def flatMap[S](f:T=>M[S]):M[S]*
*** unit *def unit[T](t:T):M[T]* //unit is defined at object level
*** map in terms of flatMap and unit
**** m map f = m flatMap (x => unit(f(x)))
**** m map f = m flatMap (f andThen unit)
*** and satisfy some algebraic laws
**** *associativity = (m flatMap f) flatMap g = m flatMap (x => f(x) flatMap g)*
**** *left unit = unit(x) flatMap f = f*
**** *right unit = m flatMap unit = m*
* state
** an object is stateful if its behaviour depends upon its history
** referential transparency
*** val x = E; val y = E; ===> x == y
** operational equivalence
*** x and y are operationally equivalent if no possible test can distinguish between them
* loops
** for loops translate to foreach
*** e.g. for (i <- 1 until 3) {...} ===> (1 until 3) foreach {...}
* Functional Reactive programming
** reactive programming is about reacting to seq of events that happen over time
** functional view: take these events and aggregate them to a signal
*** function : time => value domain
** no propagating updates to mutable state, *but create a new signal from existing one*
* Monads and effects
** Try[T] == is a monad that handles exception
* Future[T] =  a monad that handles both exception and latency
** future body is executed only once no matter how many and when callbacks are bounded
** recovery
*** recoverWith(f:PartialFunction[Throwable, Future[T]]):Future[T]
*** recover(f:PartialFunction[Throwable, T]):Future[T] 
** whenever you have a long-running computation or blocking make sure to run it inside the blocking construct
*** blocking { Thread.sleep(1000)}
** An asynchronous computation that has a blocking construct is typically scheduled in a separate thread to avoid potential deadlock.
** let's say you have a future f that waits on a timer or for a resource or a monitor condition that can only be fulfilled by some other future g.the part of the code in f that does the waiting should be wrapped in the blocking, otherwise the future g might never be run.

* Promise
** like a mailbox
** can only be completed once
*** subsequent completion attempts will fail
*** use tryComplete in such scenarios
* Iterables and observables
** type Iterable[T] = () => (() => Try[Option[T]])
** type Observable = (Try[Option[T]] => Unit) => Unit
*** type Observer[T] = (Throwable => Unit, () => Unit, T => Unit)
*** type Observable[T] = Observer[T] => Unit
* Observable
** is a monad
** flatMap is different since values will come asynchronously
** def flatMap[S](f:T => Observable[S]):Observable[S] = map(f).merge
** cold observable : when each subscriber get its own private copy of the stream
*** e.g. a stream of random numbers
*** *subscription has a side effect*
** hot observable : when source is shared by all subcribers
*** *subcription has no side effects*
** *ubsubcribing != cancellation*
** * def reduce(f:(T,T) => T):Observable[T]*
*** return of reduce is also an Observable. this is to make sure our flow is always asynchronous.
** Rx contract
*** auto unsubscribe behaviour
*** (onNext)* (onCompleted+onError)?
*** no overlapping calls
* Subjects
** is a observable
** what a promise is to a future, an subject is to a Observable
** it is more like a channel where you can publish values on one side and receive on the other side
** PublishSubjects
** ReplaySubjects
*** used a lot in RxAndroid
** AsyncSubject
*** remembers the last value before completion
** dont play well with backpressure
** have mutable state
* aside
** update syntax
*** f(e1,..,en) = E *is translated to* f.update(E1,...,En) iff there is an update method
**** also works if n = 0, f() = E ==> f.update(E)
** partial functions
*** *isDefinedAt does not gurantee runtime MatchError will not come sine it checks only outer matches*
** *collect* : it is fuction that takes a seq and a partial function and results in only those value for which Partial function is defined
*** so no runtime Match error
** *lift converts the result of applying a partial function from T => Option [T]*
** folds
*** *List(a,b,c).foldRight(z)(f) = f(a, f(b, f(c,e)))*
*** *List(a,b,c).foldLeft(z)(f) = f(f(f(z,a),b),c)*
